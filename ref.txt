JDBC API
-----------
    - Specification / set of interfaces which defines how to access a database 


    - JDBC Drivers 

    - java.sql and javax.sql packages 


    JavaApplication ---> JDBC API -----> JDBC Driver -----> database 


    JDBC API - Appication to JDBC manager Connection 
    JDBC Driver API - JDBC Manager -- Driver Connection



        Class.forName("driverclass")


        DriverManager 
            - getConnection()
            - getDrivers()




    JDBC 

            - load the drivers 
            - establish the connection 

                 Connection conection =    DriverManager.getConnection("","","");

            - create Statement object 

                - Statement 
                      Statement stmt =   connection.createStatement()

                        int result = stmt.executeUpdate("sqlcommand")       //insert/udpate/delete

                         int result = stmt.executeUpdate("INSERT INTO employee values('"+empname+"', '"+city+"', 1000.00)") 

                        ResultSet rs =  stmt.executeQuery("sqlcommand")

                        boolean result =  stmt.execute("sqlcommand")

                    - the sqlcommand is compiled everytime at db side
                    - slower if consecutive execution of same query 
                    - statement object can be only used to execute "string based" sql queries 

                    -** Statement object is suitable for CREATE, Alter, Drop tables 
                            -- good for DDL Queries 

                    -** statement object can't be used for storing & retrieving binary data i.e. arrays, files etc. 
                    -** with statement object, it is "vulnerable to SQL Injections" 

                        string ename = "---"
                        String query = "INSERT INTO employees (id, name) values(1, '"+ename+"')"


                - PreparedStatement 
                    - PS  object can be only used to execute "parameterized" sql queries 

                     String query = "INSERT INTO employees (id, name) values(?,?)"; 

                     PreparedStatement ps = connection.prepareStatement(query)

                --** it has methods to bind various object types 
                        ps.setXXXXX(placeholderindex, value)
                --** it protects against "SQL Injections"
                --** uses pre-compilations 
                --** speeds up the communication between database and jvm 
                --** PS provides "batch" execution during single db connection 
                --** PS is good for DML queries 


                - CallableStatement 




            - Execute the statement / db commands 
            - close connection 


            - Batch Processing in JDBC 


JDBC 


Object Persistence 
    - state of an object can be stored in data store, and re-created at a later point of time 
    - you can persist the data in files/relational databases 




ORM - object relation mapping tools 
    - Map the Object Model to Relational model 
    - ORM is a technique to map the representation of data from java objects to relational database tables (and vise versa) 
    - this mapping is done either using xml or annotations 
    - hides the complexity to deal with sql and low level jdbc api 


    Hibernate                           Hibernate JPA 

    Ibatis                              MyBatis

    TopLink                             EclipseLink


Hibernate xml configuration
------------------------------
    <hibernate-configuration>
        <session-factory>
                //..db configuration
        </session-factory>
    </hibernate-configuration>


JPA - Java Persistence API 
---------------------------------
    - standard specification for object mapping 

 
JPA Providers 
---------------
    - implementation of jpa 

    - Hibernate JPA
    - MyBatis
    - EclipseLink


Entity 
------------
    - Entity represents the data to be persisted, queried, or the data to be manipulated 
             - Java Object --> just instance of a class 
    - Entities are objects which are persisted / managed by the EntityManager 


    class Book {

        private long id; 
        private String title; 

        //constructor 
        //getter/setter 
        
    }

EntityManager
---------------
    - object which manages PersistenceContext 
    - EntityManager object is used to persist the Entities 

                                                  Persistence 
                                                        |

            |                                            |
         (Configuredby)                              (creates)
            |                                           |
         PersistenceContext<------- (manages)------"EntityManager"

PersistentUnit 
    - a named configuration of a set of entities 

   <persistence-unit name="jpademo1">

	</persistence-unit>
